# Auth Flow Debug Guide

## Current Issue
After sign-in, users are being redirected back to the account page instead of the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Made middleware less aggressive by only redirecting authenticated users from the exact `/account` path
- Prevents conflicting redirects from middleware and client-side code

### 2. Fixed Sign-in Form (`sign-in-form.tsx`)
- Uses `router.replace('/dashboard')` for clean navigation
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Account Page (`account\page.tsx`)
- Added client-side authentication check with redirect
- Shows loading state while checking auth status

## Debug Steps
1. Open browser developer console
2. Try signing in
3. Watch for these console messages:
   - "Sign in form submitted"
   - "Sign in successful, redirecting to dashboard"
   - "User is authenticated, redirecting to dashboard"

## Expected Flow
1. User submits sign-in form
2. Form calls `signIn()` method
3. On success, form redirects to `/dashboard`
4. Middleware allows access to dashboard for authenticated user
5. User sees dashboard

## If Still Having Issues
Check console for:
- Auth state changes
- Middleware logs
- Any error messages
- Network requests to auth endpoints
